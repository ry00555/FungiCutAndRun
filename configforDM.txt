#SET Deeptools paramenters
#binsize for windows
BIN="25"

#smoothlength setting, for smoothing the enrichment curve
SMOOTH="50"

##removed options for MNase analysis. Now, bulk reads will be plotted using deeptools using the bin and smooth parameters above ('_Bulk.bw'. A seperate MNase file will be generated to plot mononcleosome centers ('_MNase.bw') using a binsize of 1 and a smooth length of 25.
